I am Billy Chau, a computer scientist and lifelong learner. I grew up in Hong Kong and came to the United States when I was 17.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from UC Berkeley, where I explored a wide range of subjects including operating systems, hardware, machine learning, robotics, and computer vision.

In my free time, I read books and research papers on the subjects I am interested in. My goal for this year is to understand gut health and I highly encourage you to read [The Mind-Gut-Immune Connection: Understanding How Food Impacts Our Mind, Our Microbiome, and Our Immunity](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Gut-Immune-Connection-Understanding-Microbiome-Immunity/dp/0063014793/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=PlRvY&content-id=amzn1.sym.cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&pf_rd_p=cf86ec3a-68a6-43e9-8115-04171136930a&pf_rd_r=142-2309811-2543054&pd_rd_wg=lWY1M&pd_rd_r=1ebf8fdc-a6d9-47d1-989f-59bda9e5206b&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk).

I enjoy taking photos when I travel and I am planning to migrate my [portfolio](https://luxinventor.pixpa.com/) to here soon.
