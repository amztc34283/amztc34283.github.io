I am Billy Chau, a computer scientist and lifelong learner. I grew up in Hong Kong and came to the United States when I was 17.

I earned my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from UC Berkeley, where I explored a wide range of subjects including operating systems, hardware, machine learning, robotics, and computer vision.
